v1.0.1
Change the type of data in to_string() function. In several c++ compiliers, "to_string()" function 
only supports (long double) (long long) (unsinged long long) data format.

v1.0.2
Add a user-decided effective atom number for pairwise alignment (EFFECT_NATOM).

v1.0.3
Fix a bug for random rotation(ux,uy,uz sampling).

v1.0.4
Add a MIRROR option to check the reflection symmetry during alignment.

v1.0.5
Add a ELEMENT option to distinguish chemical elements (if different element, score += 0.10).

v1.0.6
Change all "extern const" statements to "extern" to prevent a bug for OSX compiler. The initial random
number is printed out.

v1.0.7
RESIZE option can now be used to determine scaling times.
For example, if RESIZE=5, the bonds in the template will be scaled as 0.96 0.98 1.00 1.02 1.04.

v1.0.8
Add BCC template in the template motif.

v1.1.0
Remove LJ scheme, use score as the only criteria to perform minimization.

v1.1.1
Add template motif 15551 and 16661.

v1.1.2
Output atomic score in the position file.

v1.1.3
Output pairing atom index in the position file.
